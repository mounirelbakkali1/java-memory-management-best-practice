     Object pooling is a technique where a pool of objects is maintained,
     and objects are reused from the pool instead of being created anew each time theyâ€™re needed.
     This can be an effective way to reduce memory usage and improve performance,
     particularly in situations where objects are frequently created and discarded.
     Object pooling can be implemented using a variety of libraries, such as :
        -> Apache Commons Pool
        -> C3P0
