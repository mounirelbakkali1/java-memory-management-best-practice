### Monitor Memory Usage


the jdk comes with a tool called jconsole that can be used to monitor memory usage of a java application. 

>jconsole can connect to a running java application and display information about the memory usage of the application while it is running. jconsole can also be used to take heap dumps of the java application. a heap dump is a snapshot of the memory usage of the java application at a given point in time. the heap dump can be analyzed to find memory leaks in the java application.
